How to install ONL
========================
Two options can be selected:
	- Put ONL installer under the root directory of the TFTP server
	- Put ONL installer to /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2 or /dev/sda3 under the root directory
with name onie-installer-arm64.bin or onie-installer.bin
e.g. /dev/sdb1/onie-installer-arm64-nxp_ls1046ardb.bin

ONIE will search the installer from /dev/sda(1/2/3) or download from TFTP server automatically,
after get installer, ONIE will run it to install ONL automatically.

===================================
notes:
1. SD card is needed, Sandisk is recommended
2. If get onie-installer locally, storage is needed.
